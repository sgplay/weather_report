This project provides a complete **Dockerized data pipeline** to fetch, process, and visualize real-time weather information.

---

## üí° Overview

The core of this solution is a **Python application** that automatically retrieves **Jerusalem weather data** from **OpenWeatherMap.org**.

The data then moves through a robust processing and storage pipeline:

$$
\text{Python App (Source)} \rightarrow \text{RabbitMQ} \rightarrow \text{Logstash} \rightarrow \text{ElasticSearch (Storage)}
$$

Finally, the results are visualized on a dedicated **"Weather Report" dashboard** in **Grafana**, which uses ElasticSearch as its primary data source.

Follow these steps to quickly build and run the entire stack on your local machine.

### 1. Build and Run the Containers

Use `docker compose` to build the necessary images and launch all services simultaneously.

```bash
docker compose up --build
